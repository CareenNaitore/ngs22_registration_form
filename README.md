This repository contains the five coding question asked in NGSchool and there coding files:

1. C1 - Fibonacci sequence

The Fibonacci sequence sequence starts with 0 and 1 (positions 1 and 2). Each next element is a sum of two preceding elements. What is the difference between elements at positions 55th and 45th multiplied by the element at position 5th?

**Answer**: 692244796375

**code**: C1 - Fibonacci sequence.ipynb


2. C2 - Protein sequence

Below you will find the amino acid sequence of BRCA2 (each letter represents one amino acid). Which amino acids are the most and the least frequent ones in this sequence and how many times they are present?

**Answer**: Least frequent: tryptophan (W, 20 times), most frequent: serine (S, 381 times)

**code** : C2 - Protein sequence.ipynb


3. C3 - Gene mutations

Below you will find 2 nucleotide sequences. They come from the MT-CYB gene that is quite special, because it consists of only 1 exon, thus the whole sequence is a coding region. 
First sequence is a reference one and the second is one with some mutation. Which of the mutations is present in this sequence and what it results in?

**Answer**:G to A at position 751, resulting in change from glycine to serine

**code**: C3 - Gene mutations.ipynb

4. C4 to C6 - Single cell RNA-seq studies

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is arguably the most dramatically growing technology in both scale and use today. A curated database of scRNA-seq studies is available at https://www.nxn.se/single-cell-studies. Answer the following questions using the snapshot of data from https://github.com/NGSchoolEU/ngs22_registration_form/blob/1cc647a3733e2c8a21b47aa497b4ca8c42457aa8/data/single-cell-studies.tsv

C4 - How many studies report data from more than one organism?
**Answer**: 147 Oragnisms

**code**: C4 to C6 - Single cell RNA-seq studies.ipynb

C5 - After excluding the studies that report data from more than one organism, for which organism there are the most published studies, and how many?

**Answer**:Organism: mouse frequency: 632

**code**: C4 to C6 - Single cell RNA-seq studies.ipynb

C6 - After excluding the studies that report data from more than one organism, for which organism there are most reported cells, and how many?

**Answer**: organism:human cell:PBMCs frequency: 25

**code**: C4 to C6 - Single cell RNA-seq studies.ipynb
